I am now an Associate Researcher at the School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Before that, I completed my postdoctoral researcher job from July 2023 to June 2025 at the School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, in Hefei, China, under the supervision of Professor [Xun Yang (Êù®Âãã)](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/yangxun/en/index.htm). I obtained my bachelor's and doctoral degrees from the School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Hefei University of Technology. During my doctoral studies, I was guided by Meng Wang [Meng Wang (Ê±™Ëêå)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rHagaaIAAAAJ) and [Dan Guo (ÈÉ≠‰∏π)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DsEONuMAAAAJ). 

My research interest includes ........  If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at [xxx](mailto:beta.songpp@gmail.com).
